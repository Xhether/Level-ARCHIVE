Experimental Multiplatform student organization application.

I created and worked on this project primarily during the summer of 2022 and never had the opportunity to fully finish and publish it,
however, in the future, it would be nice to complete this app or work on an entirely new one with a similar premise.

This app was created as my first app development project as well as my first project using Javascript and React Native and was created to
be a source of organization and completeness for students worldwide.

NOTE: There are multiple asset files that are not seen in this repository that contain images used within the app.

NOTE: This app was solely tested on iOS and may not function entirely the same on Android platforms.
